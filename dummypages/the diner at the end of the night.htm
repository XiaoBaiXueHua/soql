 midnight, and Yuuji's hungry. All he wants are some burgers, so he 
ropes his friends into a late-night adventure and finds a mysterious

<h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Work Text:</h3>
<div class="userstuff"><p>It starts with Yuuji’s stomach in the middle of the night, as everything is apt to do. His tummy is giving him the <em>rumblies</em>, the kind of rumblies that only <em>greasy fried food</em> from either a fast food chain or homely diner could satisfy. The sort of thing that Jujutsu Tech has absolutely <em>none </em>of in their kitchens, period— nevermind at this hour— which can only mean one thing…</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Hey!
 Hey, Nobara! I know you’re up, you preening peacock!” Yuuji calls, 
banging on her dorm room door. When he gets no response, he knocks 
harder and faster. “You can’t just teach me your weekend spa and 
skincare routine and expect me <em>not</em> to know your evening schedule!”</p><p>Nobara’s door snaps open, and the <em>Queen Herself</em> steps out. “Yuuji, it’s midnight. <em>What</em> do you <em>want?”</em> she snaps.</p><p>“I’m hungry,” he says.</p><p>A pause. One filled with murderous tension for sure (oh, for <em>sure</em>), but that’s never really had an effect on Yuuji when he’s in a cinnamon roll-type mood.</p><p>“You
 wanna go find some cheeseburgers or something?” he asks, so brightly he
 may as well be the sun, coming out at night to herald the end of times.
 When Nobara makes an ugly face at him, he elaborates a bit. “It’s not 
really the sort of adventure you can really <em>have</em> as a <em>country kid</em>. Going out in the middle of the night, hot on the trail of some <em>delicious</em> food—”</p><p>“I’m
 in,” Nobara says before he can even finish his sentence. She shoves him
 out of the way, steps out, and shuts the door behind her. “Let’s go get
 Megumi.”</p><p>“Huh? Why?” Not that Yuuji’s complaining— he rather <em>likes</em> Megumi, thinks of him as a real <em>swell</em> guy— but he doesn’t really consider Megumi to be the midnight-rendezvous-for-an-adventure type guy.</p><p>“Because he knows the area better?” Nobara says, gesturing with both her head and her hands. “Duh?”</p><p>“Oh,
 I thought you were going to say we needed at least one brain cell 
around to read the map,” Yuuji says, sighing with relief. Not that he 
has a map anyway, although Megumi probably does, in that shadowy pocket 
realm of his. Megumi keeps everything in there, like some sort of 
overprepared soccer mom with the ginormous purse.</p><p>Nobara smacks 
his arm. “Don’t be an idiot,” she chides, glaring at him with her hands 
on her hips. “Megumi is a certified dumbass, through and through. 
Gojou-sensei has it framed on his desk and everything; I saw it myself.”</p><p>“Uhhh,
 Nobara?” Yuuji says as they start plodding down the hall, their only 
light coming from the bright, silvery moon as it streams through the 
windows. “I’m pretty sure that’s a joke.”</p><p>“Don’t be ridiculous,” Nobara snaps. “It said <em>‘Legal Department of Dumbassery’</em> on it and everything. You’re telling me that’s not legit?”</p><p>Yuuji
 wants to say that he doesn’t think that the Legal Department of 
Dumbassery is a real governmental division, but he doesn’t know enough 
about the government to dispute it. “I’ll ask Nanamin about it later,” 
he decides aloud, and the two of them park themselves in front of 
Megumi’s door.</p><p>“Oi!” Nobara barks, knocking so hard on Megumi’s 
door that she might actually break through it. “I know you’re awake, you
 hideous bat. Answer us, dammit!”</p><p>The door slides open with a sharp <em>crack!</em></p><p>“<em><strong>What</strong></em>,” Megumi grumbles, glaring at the both of them.</p><p>“I wanna go find a wild burger joint!” Yuuji chirps.</p><p>“And <em>I</em> didn’t move all the way out to <em>Tokyo</em> to be fed <em>nothing </em>but a <em>proper diet</em>
 decided for me by a licensed doctor instead of all the greasy fast food
 I can cram into my pretty, lipsticked maw,” Nobara adds.</p><p>“You’re wearing lipstick right now?” Yuuji asks, aside.</p><p>“I’m talking about in general,” Nobara says, also aside.</p><p>Megumi
 frowns at them for a second, then plods back into his room, unplugs his
 phone, and returns to the doorway as he’s typing something in. “Is 
there anything nearby that’s still open?”</p><p>“Don’t do that!!” Yuuji says, snatching Megumi’s phone out of his hands and <em><strong>YEETING</strong></em> it back onto Megumi’s bed. “You’re gonna murder the spirit of fun that comes with nighttime exploration!!!”</p><p>“Also, full offense, but you take forever and a day to make decisions,” Nobara adds.</p><p>While
 Megumi sends murderous (but ultimately empty) looks their way, Nobara 
and Yuuji each grab one of his arms and drag him down the hall with 
them.</p><p>“Did <em>either</em> of you bring your phone along,” Megumi 
asks, exasperated, but already long since resigned to this sort of 
thing. (Because if Nobara and Yuuji are ride or die, <em>he’s</em> strapped to the roof of the car with no hope of escape.)</p><p>“No,
 of course not!” Yuuji replies as they exit the gates and plunge into 
the surrounding woods. “Nanamin has access to my location!! We can’t 
have a Super Secret Jujutsu Tech First Years Midnight Outing if the <em>adults</em> know where we are.”</p><p>“Knowing Gojou-sensei though, he might have already long since implanted a tracking chip in Megumi’s skull,” Nobara says.</p><p>“Don’t
 be ridiculous,” Megumi snaps, though he knows he has no way of proving 
them false. He finally twists his arms out of their grasp and begins 
following them out of his own free will. “What if we get mugged? Or 
encounter a curse?”</p><p>“Then we beat the shit out of them,” Yuuji says, easy breezy lemon squeezy. “No big deal.”</p><p>“Yeah,
 I’m not sure why you’re so worried about all this,” Nobara says, 
pulling her hammer out of her belt loops for a few trick flips.</p><p>“<em>You brought your hammer but not your cell phone</em>??” Megumi throws his hands in the air in defeat.</p><p>“Yeah, and also a pocket mirror.” Nobara pulls that out too and inspects her face as they walk.</p><p>Megumi
 mutters to himself, “I am an intellectual locked in a tent with the 
circus clowns when I should be debating in the forum.” He shakes his 
head, then speaks up. “If you’re going to be so <em>vain, </em>why not just bring your phone along and take more of your bazillions of selfies?”</p><p>“In <em>this</em> lighting?” Nobara scoffs. “Better to take no new selfies at all than have a single ugly one.”</p><p>“Not like most of yours are all that great anyway.”</p><p>“What was that?”</p><p>Megumi rolls his eyes, not caring if she can see him or not. “Don’t worry about it, <em>Your Majesty</em>.”</p><p>Nobara
 claps the mirror closed with a satisfied little grunt, pockets it, and 
runs ahead to catch up with Yuuji, who has been blazing the trail at top
 speed, as he turns off the established trail and into what appears to 
be a dark corner of the forest. “Hey, dumbass, where are you going? This
 looks like it’s more likely to take us to a murder cabin in the woods 
than the sweet, sweet cheeseburgers of our dreams.”</p><p>“Well, we don’t <em>know</em> that,” Yuuji easily replies.</p><p>“Oh, so you’re just listening to the same little voice in your head that would tell you to go <em>towards </em>the
 light when you’re bleeding out in somebody’s arms, huh?” Now it’s 
Nobara’s turn to throw her hands into the air from exasperation.</p><p>“I can’t heaaaaar you~~~ fireflies!!” With a scream of delight, Yuuji runs off.</p><p>It’s
 not firefly season, but Megumi is a city kid who doesn’t know that, and
 the other two, while from farther out, aren’t familiar with the local 
firefly season either. So, naïvely, they follow the fireflies deeper 
into the woods, scrambling over fallen logs and wading through the brush
 in search of more floating, flickering fairy lights.</p><p>“Woaaah, guys, check it out!” Yuuji says, stumbling over a rock and crashing through a bush. “Guys, it’s a diner!!”</p><p><em><strong>“WHAT???”</strong></em> Nobara bellows, following him. “No way. <em>No <strong>way</strong></em>. You’re lying—”</p><p>“Oh, my god, he’s not,” Megumi says as they break into the exact same clearing.</p><p align="center">

</p><p>And a diner it so clearly is, with the word <strong>DINER</strong>
 lit up in blocky, all-caps English right above the windows streaming 
warm, yellow light out into the abyss. (Where the electricity for all 
this light came from is literally anyone’s guess, but none of them 
bother.) There’s no one outside, but through the windows, a few patrons 
are visible, sitting in booths or at barstools, as well as a waitress 
hustling and bustling about.</p><p>“Seems legit,” says Yuuji, then jerks his head at the door. “Let’s go.”</p><p>“Hold on a second,” says Megumi, signalling Nobara, who’s already two steps ahead of him and grabbing Yuuji by the hood.</p><p>(“Ack,” goes Yuuji, now halfway to the ground.)</p><p>“Don’t
 you think this whole thing is kind of really suspicious?” Megumi asks, 
summoning his divine dogs by the light of the diner and gestures to a 
lonely car parked near the far side of the building. “Who drives a car 
off the road and into the middle of the woods at this hour?”</p><p>“Oh!” Yuuji makes a little surprised sound. “I hadn’t noticed that!”</p><p>There’s
 a beat of quiet to emphasize the stupidity of his one-track mind. Not 
silence, as there’s still the sounds of the dogs sniffing about and the 
creatures of the night making their song, but there’s a pointed lack of 
speaking.</p><p>Nobara releases Yuuji (who falls to the ground, screams a
 little on the way down) and pulls her hammer out again to toss it 
around in thought. “Personally, in my pretty opinion, that’s a <em>good</em> sign, if anything. It means that this place is <em>so good</em> that someone drove through all that to get here.</p><p>Yuuji takes this opportunity to crawl over to the divine dogs and start ruffling around with them.</p><p>Megumi squints at Nobara in an, “are you serious? Are you <em>kidding </em>me? Surely, you <em>must</em> be fucking with me,” sort of way.</p><p>But
 before he says anything, Yuuji’s stomach rumbles. Very loudly. He 
pauses his petting of the white wolf (while the black one repeatedly 
jumps on and off his back) and looks up.</p><p>His friends stare down at him expectantly.</p><p>“I’m hungry,” he says simply.</p><p>The
 tension between Yuuji and Megumi in particular grows to be so thick, 
Nobara almost expects cursed energy to start arcing through the air 
between them before they kiss-kiss fall in love. The last bit she’d 
rather not be around for, but if it <em>does</em> happen, she’s prepared to just walk into the diner herself and order a soda for herself and <em>only </em>herself.</p><p>The
 dogs start whining, oblivious to it all. Megumi sighs as he crouches 
down to pet the black one, ruffle its fur real well, and he says, “All 
right.”</p><p>“WOOHOO!” Yuuji jumps up (almost clearing the diner roof), then high-fives Nobara on the way down.</p><p>“MID-NIGHT BUR-GERS, MID-NIGHT BUR-GERS!!” they chant, spinning around in a circle whilst holding hands.</p><p>Megumi
 stands up, and his dogs whine at him. He gives each of them a quick 
scruffle behind the ears— “shh, shh,” he says, “stay out here, now, <em>stay,</em>” —then (<em>much</em> less tenderly) turns to his drooling comrades and says, “Let’s go, then.”</p><p>Nobara and Yuuji have one last whirl about, one last high-octane high five, then together, the trio walk into the diner.</p><p>The <em>first</em> abnormal thing that <em>pops</em>
 right out at them are the dolls. Somehow, none of them noticed it from 
the outside looking in, but there’s a long, continuous shelf along the 
wall with dozens upon dozens of perfect, porcelain dolls sitting on it, 
their eyes either a creepy, inky black, or that obnoxious shade of 
Gojou-sensei blue.</p><p>“Oh, how cute,” Nobara says, tapping her chin 
thoughtfully, evidently undisturbed. She reaches out to perhaps touch 
one doll’s straw curls—</p><p>“Please don’t touch those, Miss; they’re vintage.”</p><p>The three kids jump with surprise, so suddenly does the waitress call out to them.</p><p>She tightens her blonde ponytail as she waddles towards them, flashing an apologetic smile that Megumi <em>swears</em> is just a <em>little</em> too wide. “Sorry about that, dears,” she says, “just follow me, and I’ll get you situated just fine.”</p><p>Nobara,
 Yuuji, and Megumi exchange looks. Looks that say, “Are you guys seeing 
this? This shit’s kind of creepy,” on Megumi’s end, “I’m gonna murder 
that lady for keeping me from touching that stupid little doll,” on 
Nobara’s end, and “Are you guys ready for burgers? That was kind of 
weird, and it’s making me kind of nervous, but really I’m just ready for
 burgers,” on Yuuji’s end, to be precise.</p><p>(They don’t really have the whole same wavelength thing down <em>quite </em>yet.)</p><p>“Thank
 you,” Yuuji says in hesitant English as they follow her almost like 
ducklings, although the waitress doesn’t seem to notice the switch.</p><p>Yuuji looks to Megumi for reassurance.</p><p>Megumi
 gives it a try. “Can we get a window booth?” he asks, wanting to keep 
watch over his dogs, just in case something goes awry.</p><p>“Of 
course!” the waitress chirps, guiding them to a booth where the only 
thing separating the kids from the divine dogs is a single panel of 
glass.</p><p>“Oi, what’s with the English?” Nobara complains. She did <em>not</em> come to a sorcery school in Tokyo to rack her brains for foreign vocab, after all. “She speaks Japanese just fine!”</p><p>“Doesn’t feel right,” Megumi mutters darkly (emo-ly).</p><p>Yuuji shrugs. “Just felt like trying it out, I guess.”</p><p>“Uhuh.” Nobara crosses her arms, sitting by herself on the opposite side of the boys.</p><p>“Are we sure that was Japanese?” Megumi asks. Because he’s not.</p><p>Nobara
 shrugs and picks up one of the menus. “I could understand her just 
fine,” she says, propping up the menu to show off the elaborately 
lettered ‘<em>Milliways</em>’ on the front.</p><p>(So elaborately lettered, in fact, that none of them realize that it’s a word and not a pretty squiggle design.)</p><p>“It doesn’t <em>sound</em> quite right, though,” Yuuji argues.</p><p>“Your
 ears must be broken, then,” Nobara sniffs. “I bet Sukuna is eating your
 ear canal from the inside out.” She pokes her menu, and as it falls 
down, she takes out her pocket mirror to check her reflection—</p><p>“Hey,
 what the—” She twists around, cranes her neck to get a better look at 
the other people in the diner, but the waitress happens to choose that 
exact moment to pop out of hot dog diddly darn <em>nowhere.</em></p><p>“While y’all are choosing your orders, can I get you kids anything to drink?” she asks, pleasantly as ever.</p><p>(Now that the boys have mentioned it, there <em>is</em> something odd about the way she speaks. Nobara <em>swears</em> she caught something in that last sentence, but she just can’t place <em>what</em>, exactly, is off about it.)</p><p>“Ah,
 yes, I’ll have a strawberry milkshake,” Yuuji says, evidently deciding 
that it’s too much work to do everything in English if the waitress 
doesn’t seem to notice or care. “Pink as the demon that possesses my 
soul every other Wednesday night from seven to nine.”</p><p>“All right,” she says without missing a beat. “Anything else?”</p><p>“Yeah,
 what the fuck is ‘the icy breezy please don’t leave me tea’?” Nobara 
asks, sliding her menu towards the waitress and jabbing a finger at a 
picture on the menu.</p><p>“One iced tea for the lady,” the waitress replies, writing that down.</p><p>“Wait, no—” Nobara begins, but the waitress has long since moved on.</p><p>“Anything else?” (Her smile now looks <em>very </em>sockable.)</p><p>“Uhh, yeah, may I have a Calpis?” Megumi asks, and now it’s <em>his</em> turn to be on the receiving end of one of Nobara’s death glares.</p><p>For
 what feels like the very first time, the waitress blinks. “Pardon?” she
 asks, her blinking getting owlish and rapid, like she has to make up 
for her earlier lacking.</p><p>Megumi starts to sweat under everyone’s gaze. “A Calpis,” he repeats. <em>Do they not have those here? They’re sold in literally every convenience store in the city.</em></p><p>The waitress clicks her tongue while Nobara <em>harrumphs</em> and walls herself off from the outside world with her menu again.</p><p>“I
 don’t know if we have those,” the waitress says, tapping the end of her
 pencil against her chin. “I’ll have to check the fridge. Is there 
anything else I can get you otherwise?”</p><p>Megumi scrambles for the menu. “Uhhh…”</p><p>“Dude, just order a coffee,” Yuuji jokes as he slides the other boy his own menu.</p><p>Megumi scowls as he pretends to look over the menu again. “No,” he says, stubborn as an ass. “That method of staying up late is <em>artificial</em>.”</p><p>Nobara snickers. “Yeah, Yuuji; don’t you know that Megumi likes to keep those eyebags of his <em>authentically</em> Gucci?”</p><p>Megumi
 glowers at her, even pushing down her menu to do so. “I will dump 
Yuuji’s hair dye into your shampoo,” he threatens through gritted teeth,
 in that same sort of tone you’d use to say, <em>“you suck.”</em></p><p>“And I’ll make <em>you</em> drink it,” Nobara retorts, in that same sort of tone you’d use to say, “<em>and you swallow</em>.”</p><p>Megumi looks at the waitress, who is, for <em>whatever</em> reason, <em>entirely</em>
 unperturbed. “I’ll have an ice water,” he says, a bit more dead inside 
than usual. He needs it, he knows, to keep himself awake and alert in 
this god forsaken diner with his idiots, after all.</p><p>“All right, then, I’ll be back with your drinks right quick now,” the waitress says, and she bustles off.</p><p>The kids breathe a collective sigh of relief.</p><p>“She was weird,” Nobara declares, as though she’s decided this <em>all</em> on her own. “I don’t know if I like her.”</p><p>“Nobara, you barely like <em>anyone</em>,” Megumi points out.</p><p>“I like Maki-senpai,” she says.</p><p>“We know,” Megumi replies.</p><p>“She’s so <em>cool</em> and <em>pretty</em>~”</p><p>“So we’ve heard.”</p><p>“<em><strong>I</strong></em> think <em>you’re</em> cool and pretty, Megumi!!” Yuuji chirps, bouncing around in his seat and shaking Megumi’s shoulder as he does so.</p><p>“Thank
 you, Yuuji,” Megumi replies dryly, allowing himself to be rattled 
around. “I’m so flattered my voice has literally been flattened.”</p><p>“Eww, Yuuji, get better taste.” Nobara wrinkles her nose and sticks out her tongue. “Megumi is, like, <em>super</em> ugly.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Megumi grunts, looking rather like a horse with its ears pinned back. (Probably doesn’t help that Yuuji is <em>still</em> shaking him around.)</p><p>“Like, look at his hair. <em>Hideous</em>.”
 She reaches over and ruffles it around, just to make it worse on 
purpose. “He looks like a stained mop after a calligraphy accident that 
got stuck in a microwave with a piece of tin foil,” she continues. 
“Literally, the only person I can think of who’s uglier would be 
Gojou-sensei.”</p><p>“AWW, YOU THINK I’M PRETTY??” Yuuji asks, forgoing continuing to rattle Megumi in favor of now rattling the table.</p><p>“Of course not, but you’re easier on the eyes than Mr. Rolls Out Of Bed And Makes A Mirror Cry So Hard It Shatters here.”</p><p>“Wow, <em>thanks</em>.”</p><p>“Aww, you’re welcome~”</p><p>“Oh,
 but!” Yuuji lets go of the table, hits his palm with a fist. “That 
reminds me! If you guys were to curse Gojou-sensei, what would you curse
 him with?”</p><p>Nobara and Megumi exchange looks of mild confusion.</p><p>“Not in a sorcery sort of way,” Yuuji clarifies.</p><p>“I’d make it so that his lips are perpetually chapped and peeling,” Nobara <em>instantly</em> answers. “And if he tries using more of that stupid, <em>garishly pink</em> lip gloss of his, then his lips just peel off. No more glossy lips for sensei.”</p><p>“For someone so vain, you sure do hate the idea of Gojou’s lip gloss,” Megumi comments.</p><p>“I <em>must</em> be the <em>fairest</em> in the land.” Nobara flicks her bangs out of her eyes.</p><p>“I thought you <em>just</em> said that Gojou-sensei was the ugliest man you’ve ever seen in your life,” Yuuji points out.</p><p>But Nobara just pats him on the face as she shooshes him. “Silence, Yuuji,” she says.</p><p>Yuuji
 makes some sort of guttural noise of displeasure (not unlike a dog), 
bats her hand away, and turns to Megumi. “Anyway, what about you?”</p><p>Megumi ponders it for a moment. He’s more of a direct action kind of guy, truth be told, but if given free reign…</p><p>“I’d make it so that he always <em>feels</em> like there’s a rock in his shoe, but every time he stops to try to shake it out, nothing comes out,” he says.</p><p>Nobara and Yuuji stare at him, mouths agape.</p><p>“Megumi, that’s so <em>evil</em>,” Yuuji says, hushed with awe.</p><p>“And <em>doable</em>,” Nobara adds. “Let’s pick up some rocks on the way back.”</p><p>“Provided the food arrives and we <em>get</em> to go back,” Megumi grumbles. How late <em>is</em> it, anyway? It’s been…</p><p>Megumi
 checks his wrist for the time, then realizes he’d already taken off his
 watch for the night before he’d been kidnapped by his two doofus 
classmates for the ransom of buying cheeseburgers with them. “What time 
is it?”</p><p>Yuuji jams his hand into his pocket.</p><p>“I left my phone in the dorm!” he declares, as though it wasn’t <em>his </em>idea to do so in the first place.</p><p><em>Wonderful. How delightfully obvious.</em>
 Megumi has to restrain himself from just patting Yuuji on the head like
 one of his dogs and going, “It’s okay, it’s not your fault you’re so 
dumb.” He turns to Nobara.</p><p>She pulls out a nail file and begins examining her nails. “Me? Wear a watch? And risk getting a watch tan? I think not.”</p><p>Megumi
 heaves an exasperated sigh and pulls a leg in so he can sit a little 
taller by sitting on it. He scans the diner, taking in fully the rest of
 their surroundings for the first time.</p><p>There’s the cook, working 
merrily away in full sight of the dining area. Nearest him are three men
 by the sounters, each sitting on a barstool with a newspaper in their 
hands. One looks like your average businessman, down to the leather 
briefcase sitting by his feet. The next looks like a private eye, with 
the Sherlock Holmes style hat and everything. The third looks perhaps 
like a fisherman, with a plaid flannel shirt, damp-looking denim 
overalls, along with a little, yellow hat.</p><p>(Never once does any of our trio notice any of the three counter men actually turn the page of their paper.)</p><p>On
 the other side of the diner, in a little corner table, appears to be a 
couple straight out of old American TV. A jock and a cheerleader, 
drinking a milkshake together, by the looks of it. They seem too lost in
 each other to notice anything else— which, <em>gross</em>, makes Megumi look away.</p><p>He spots a clock hanging on the wall, cranes his neck to get a better look at it so he can read it. “2:45— what the—?”</p><p>“It’s probably just broken,” Yuuji says, getting up a little bit to mirror Megumi.</p><p>Megumi sighs, begins his search for another clock, because there <em>has</em> to be another one in here, right?</p><p>Except
 that’s it. No other people. Nothing else of note, except for the dolls 
they’ve already started tuning out of their lines of sight.</p><p>(What the fuck happened to their waitress?)</p><p>“Here are y’all’s drinks; sorry we didn’t have what you wanted, darling.”</p><p>The kids flinch as their drinks are placed before them, the waitress once again materializing out of nowhere.</p><p>“Oh, sorry if I scared you kids,” she says. “Anyway, have you decided on your orders?”</p><p>“I’d
 like two cheeseburgers and some fries,” Yuuji says, recovering quickly 
such as to not miss a beat. He wants his simple midnight snack, after 
all, and just sip-sip-sipping away at his milkshake isn’t gonna do it 
for him.</p><p>Nobara takes that second to recover. “I’ll take the… 
‘Miss Steak Wake to Bake For Ninety-Nine Nonsense Scents’.” She makes a 
funky face at the menu, as though it’s changing its words on purpose 
just to make her feel silly.</p><p>Yuuji barks with laughter. “What does that even mea— <em>ack</em>!”</p><p>(That last part comes from the way Nobara folds up her menu all nice and neat (as a lady should always do) and <em>bonk-bonk-bonk</em>s him on the head with it.)</p><p>“All
 right, so that will be two orders of cheeseburgers and fries, and one 
order of the House Specialty Steak Stake; would that be all, or am I 
missing something?”</p><p>Nobara and Yuuji look at Megumi, who pushes his menu into the center of the table.</p><p>“Surprise
 me,” he says, dead tired of this place already. He doesn’t expect to 
like anything they serve, but it would be a waste of time if all he got 
was this measly ice water.</p><p>Speaking of his ice water, he raises 
his glass to his lips and lets a couple ice cubes fall into his mouth 
for him to crunch on, because for whatever reason they’ve given him what
 appears to be more ice than actual water.</p><p>The waitress smiles and
 nods, clicks her pen and pockets it alongside her notepad as she says, 
“All righty, then; your orders will arrive shortly. Just sit back, 
relax, and enjoy the show~”</p><p>The trio blinks, and she’s gone, along with their menus.</p><p>“That was weird,” Nobara says yet again. “Our waitress is literally <em>so</em> weird.”</p><p>“Could
 be weirder,” Yuuji says cheerfully. “Instead of a waitress, we could 
have had our orders taken by a talking cow with biiiig anime eyes that 
opens up by singing about how it and its cow friends built this city on 
rock and roll before proceeding to ask us which parts of it we’d like to
 dine on tonight.”</p><p>Megumi grimaces while Nobara gives him a bug-eyed stare.</p><p>“What the fresh <em>fuck</em> are you talking about?” Nobara furiously whispers, leaning across the table to gesture at him.</p><p>“What? Have neither of you ever seen—” Yuuji begins, but there’s a <em>thud</em> against the window that chills their blood.</p><p>Slowly, mechanically, all three turn their heads to look out the window, feeling morbidly like puppets caught on a string.</p><p>There’s nothing but the empty blackness.</p><p>Megumi
 stands up so fast, he knocks his knee against the table, causing him to
 seethe at the sudden numbness. His dogs, are they—</p><p>He looks to 
the ground outside and breathes a sigh of relief. Both Black and White 
are safe and sound, although they’re not sitting, the way he told them 
to. Instead, they’re crouching low to the ground, on the defensive 
against…</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>…the void, it seems.</p><p>Just the void.</p><p>The tension leaves Megumi, replaced by a sort of empty confusion.</p><p>“I’m not crazy, right?” Yuuji stage whispers, which really only does the obscenely unnecessary service of making his friends <em>more</em> nervous. “There’s nothing there, right? No giant curse, nothing?”</p><p>Nobara lets out a quiet breath. “As much as it physically pains me to say this, just this once, Yuuji, <em>you’re not crazy</em>.”</p><p>The
 fact that he’s not alone doesn’t reassure Megumi in the slightest, who 
knows that the touch of insanity present in any sorcerer is the key to 
their survival. He sits back down slowly (hey, isn’t it weird that 
literally no one in the diner batted an eye at his sudden outburst?), 
uneasy.</p><p>Something’s not right, that much has long since been 
established. Unfortunately, Yuuji is far too hungry for them to have any
 other options aside from hope the food arrives soon, eat quickly, and 
get out of here fast.</p><p>Megumi scans the diner again while Nobara 
and Yuuji fall into their usual rhythm of ludicrous bicker-banter about 
who-cared-what (probably about whether the American English rhotic 
counted as a vowel). Not a single person has moved; he doubts anyone’s 
even <em>blinked</em>, and the same can be said about the walls of creepy dolls (to the best of <em>his</em> knowledge anyway). By all accounts, everything is fi— <strong>what was that</strong>.</p><p>“Hey,
 Yuuji, I dare you to touch one of the dolls,” Nobara says, swirling her
 straw around in her iced tea. She doesn’t like it very much, finds it 
to be much too watery for her tastes, but there’s <em>nothing</em> like a good, persistent <em>clinky-dink-dink</em> sound to drive Megumi insane.</p><p>“What’s in it for—” Yuuji begins, but Megumi slaps a hand over his mouth.</p><p>“Yuuji,” he hisses, and the boy in question shivers subtly at the way Megumi’s warm breath tickles his ear. “I swear to god, do <em>not</em> touch the dolls.”</p><p>(Yuuji bites his lip; Megumi’s hand is warm and soft and nice, but kind of hard to breathe through.)</p><p>“Aww, little baby boy <em>Megumi</em> scared of the <em>dollies</em>?”
 Nobara teases, reaching into her back pocket. Pulling out her straw 
doll, she shoves it into his face, and at the same time, Yuuji licks 
Megumi’s palm.</p><p>“Guys—” Megumi gibbers, almost falling out of his seat from how violently he jerks away from them.</p><p>Nobara
 tosses her doll up in the air, cackling, but swipes for it a second too
 early, and it lands on the table. She shrugs it off, though, until—</p><p>“Nobara, behind you!”</p><p>At the sound of Yuuji’s warning, Nobara rubbernecks and finds herself face to face with an <em>enormous</em>
 slug seeping out from behind one of the nearby dolls. She yelps, 
scrambling out of her chair, nearly tripping to the floor, as she makes a
 mad grab for her hammer and nails.</p><p>“Gross, gross, gross, gross, gross, <em>gross</em>,”
 she says, her hammer starting to glow blue with cursed energy. She 
stops just before she tosses her nails into the air, though, getting a 
better look at her target and realizing what it is.</p><p>“Oh,” she says, feeling a little foolish as she lets her hammer die off. “It’s just a little bitty baby curse. No big deal.”</p><p>“Where’d it come from?” Yuuji asks as Megumi crawls back into his seat.</p><p>“Probably
 just Megumi’s bad attitude,” Nobara jokes, tossing up a nail and 
letting it fly towards the small fry with a bright, little <em>ping!</em></p><p>The curse hisses and writhes for a moment before it disintegrates.</p><p>Nobara
 sits down, smooths out her skirt. “That was no big deal,” she says, 
with a toss of her hair. She pulls out her pocket mirror, checks herself
 out in it, angles it over her shoulder to check out the diner behind, 
and nearly drops it remembering something. She snaps it shut, opens her 
mouth to say something to the boys—</p><p>“Sorry that took so long, kids; the cook was having a bit of a moment earlier.”</p><p>Nobara flinches, scrambling away from the waitress until her back hits the window with a hollow <em>thud!</em> Heart pounding, she stares at the older woman with wide, frantic eyes, but the <em>waitress doesn’t even blink</em> as she sets down three plates in front of the three kids.</p><p>Nobara
 scrambles for her mirror, then realizes it’s still in her hand, 
mistakenly drops it on her lap, then grapples around for it like it’s a 
bar of soap in the bath.</p><p>“Thank you!” Yuuji chirps, bouncing up in his seat to emphasize his excited gratuity.</p><p>“Of course!” The waitress bows, and she’s gone by the time Nobara gets a proper handle on her mirror again.</p><p>Nobara
 slams it down on the table, eyes her steak wearily. While at least it’s
 not well-done, it doesn’t even look like that great of a steak— she’s 
from the country; she <em>knows</em> how good freshly butchered and grilled cow looks and tastes. Well, at least it’s better than what <em>Megumi</em>
 got: four dinky little mozzarella sticks with a side of red bell pepper
 chunks. He’s making a face at the dish right as Nobara forgets what she
 was about to say in favor of insulting him.</p><p>“Awww, <em>Megu-Megu-chan</em>, I forgot that your taste buds are still babies,” she says to him, stirring around her straw to annoy him further.</p><p>“Don’t call me that,” Megumi says, pushing his food around with a fork.</p><p>“Okay, then, Min-Min~”</p><p>Megumi stands up, leans over the table, and jabs his fork at Nobara, who grins as she ducks out of the way.</p><p>“I am hereby revoking your right to call me by my given name,” he says through gritted teeth.</p><p>“Oooh, emphasizing your <em>close</em> relationship with Yuuji now, huh?”</p><p>While they’re fighting like that, Yuuji himself has already said his thanks and has begun scarfing down his absolutely <em>immaculate</em> looking burgers and fries. Like, these are the biggest, <em>juiciest</em> burgers he’s ever seen in his <em>LIFE</em>,
 with perfectly crisp, beautifully golden fries. He’s not gonna let some
 stupid, petty squabble/fistfight between his two best friends get in 
the way of inhaling that so fast it would make Sonic the Hedgehod weep 
tears of envy.</p><p>That is until Megumi slaps his next french fry out of his hand.</p><p>“Hey! What was that for!” Yuuji says, sliding under the table to pick it up and eat it anyway.</p><p>“<em>Yuuji</em>— Yuuji, <em>spit that out</em>!” Megumi seizes Yuuji’s face in his hands, forces him to open his mouth.</p><p>Tragically,
 Yuuji has already long since invested in the neat parlour trick of 
being able to swallow with his mouth open, which he performs for Megumi 
right then and there (mostly out of panic).</p><p>“Why?? What’s going on???” Yuuji sputters with great difficulty, as Megumi still has his face squished between his hands.</p><p>Megumi pulls Yuuji’s face close to his own (Yuuji starts to sweat, and really, with eyes <em>that</em> intense staring straight into your soul— <em>who wouldn’t</em>?) and says, very seriously, “This place is haunted.”</p><p>“<em>Haaah</em>?”</p><p>Yuuji
 starts wriggling, so Megumi lets him go. He knocks on the glass window,
 and while the fact that it rattles isn’t particularly reassuring, the 
way a little grey-green curse oozes and flutters its way out is even 
less so. In fact, it’s rather <em>unsettling</em>.</p><p>Yuuji shoots 
Nobara a look, looking for some sort of reassurance that Megumi is 
merely messing around with him, but she simply gestures for him to come 
over to her side as Megumi strangles the curse to death with his bare 
hands.</p><p>Which he does, by sliding under the table and popping back up on the other side, naturally.</p><p>“Check
 it out,” she says, flipping open her now-cracked mirror (what, you 
thought she could just slam and drop it all the time without damaging 
it?) and angling it at something in the background.</p><p>Yuuji cuddles 
up close, rests his chin on the top of her head, and tries his best to 
see anything other than her ear in the mirror. “What? What is it?” he 
asks, until Nobara elbows him in the gut.</p><p>“You’re going to muss my hair,” she complains, then just hands him the mirror. “Look for the cook.”</p><p>Yuuji
 twists his neck around, spots the cook, then takes the mirror for 
himself to try and angle it in such a way that the cook is reflected in 
it. And yet, no matter how hard he tries, while he can easily find the 
other wall, for some reason, the cook never appears.</p><p>Frowning, he 
throws an arm over the back of the booth and pulls himself onto his 
knees to get a better look at the diner around him, then realizes that 
despite there being several other parties present in the diner, he 
doesn’t see them in the mirror. Not the jock and cheerleader, not the 
trio of bland, little men sitting on stools with their newspapers and 
blocking the cook half the time, and <em>certainly</em> not the cook when he’s— <em>again</em>— only sort of visible maybe half the time.</p><p>“They’re not showing up,” he complains at his normal volume, but Nobara and Megumi duck into his space and <em>shoosh</em> him.</p><p>“Yuuji,”
 Nobara says, putting her hands on his shoulders (pauses, plucks her 
mirror out of his hands, and tucks it away in her tool belt again), 
“those aren’t people.”</p><p>A pause.</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>“Those aren’t human beings!” Megumi whisper shouts, furiously gesturing. Nobara rattles him around aggressively.</p><p>“I know, I know, I <em>know</em>! I got it the first time; I was joking!” Yuuji says, a little overwhelmed by their reactions, truth be told. “It’s <em>jooooke</em>.”</p><p>Megumi sits back down, and Nobara lets him go, both sighing in sync.</p><p>(“Jinx,” Nobara mutters.)</p><p>(“Under the roof,” Megumi mumbles back.)</p><p>(Nobara swears, foiled.)</p><p>Yuuji
 crawls under the table to get back to his plate of food, which, all 
things considered, still looks pretty good. (That’s not saying much, 
since he eats Sukuna’s musty-ass thousand-year-old fingers for breakfast
 almost literally.) “So,” he says, sure to keep his voice low, as he 
sloooooowly creeps his hand towards the fries. “What are we gonna do?”</p><p>Megumi swats Yuuji’s hand away from the plate. “For <em>one</em> thing,” he says, “we are <em>not</em> going to eat the food.”</p><p>“But that’s <em>rude</em>!” Yuuji protests. “We <em>have</em> to finish.”</p><p>“Yuuji, you don’t understand,” Megumi says. “I think the restaurant is targeting you.”</p><p>Yuuji pouts. “Nobara, hand me your rubber mallet.”</p><p>Instead, she bonks <em>him</em> on the head with it. “Listen, dumbass. I can’t believe we have to explain this kind of shit to you.”</p><p>“He doesn’t <em>know</em> any better,” Megumi argues. “No one’s <em>taught</em> him anything about—”</p><p>
<em>Bonk-bonk-bonk!</em>
</p><p>Megumi grabs her hammer, and as they play tug-of-war with it, he 
continues explaining himself to Yuuji, who— mercifully— is no longer 
trying to eat anything. “Think about it. Everything about this place is 
trying to lure you in. <em>You</em> were the one to find this place in the middle of buttfuck nowhere—”</p><p>“Hehehe you said ‘butt’,” Yuuji says. “Nobara, he said—”</p><p>
<em>Bonk. </em>
</p><p>“—<em>You</em> were the one to get the <em>objectively</em> 
good-looking food,” Megumi continues. “And frankly, had I not stopped 
you, I don’t think anyone was going to stop you from touching that 
stupid fucking doll either, unlike with Nobara.”</p><p>Yuuji props his 
chin up with a fist, giving his best thinking face. “I see, I see,” he 
says, making his mouth extremely small as he talks for absolutely no 
good reason.</p><p>His eyes slide back towards their dinner plates. “So 
it’s cursed?” he asks. “The food, I mean. And everything else, too, I 
guess.” His eyes pop a bit wider. “Hey, how come we can’t see any cursed
 residue or whatever?”</p><p>“It’s magic, Yuuji,” Nobara says.</p><p>“That’s no fun,” Yuuji says.</p><p>“We. Don’t. <em>Know</em>,” Megumi says. “Maybe we wandered into someone’s domain? Doesn’t matter; we need to get out.”</p><p>“Why
 don’t we just walk out the door?” Yuuji asks, but something deeply 
unfortunate happens before either of his friends can respond.</p><p>“<em>Feed</em> me, Yuuji.”</p><p>The kids scream when Sukuna’s mouth pops out to talk.</p><p>“What the <em>fuck</em>— bad time to let the bitch out, Yuuji!” Nobara screams, scrabbling for the steak knife that came with her meal.</p><p>Sukuna cackles, moves from Yuuji’s cheek to his forehead, and Megumi has to <em>catch Nobara’s arm</em> before she mistakenly causes serious bodily harm on reflex.</p><p>“Aww,
 you damn fuck shitting bitch, and here I thought I’d be able to have 
some good old-fashioned angsty bloodshed,” the King of Curses (never may
 he reign) teases. “Such a shame. Unless I—”</p><p>Yuuji seizes a 
handful of fries (beautiful, golden, crispy fries that he still wishes 
he could eat) and crams them all at once into Sukuna’s mouth.</p><p>Sukuna chokes, tries to spit them out, but apparently, Yuuji is <em>determined</em> to have his plate clean by <em>any</em> means necessary.</p><p>“<em>Gross</em>,”
 Sukuna hisses, retreating from Yuuji’s forehead to migrate into his 
hand, only to have Nobara stab her mediocre-at-best steak and jam it 
into Sukuna’s stupid, little cursed mouth.</p><p>“We’re playing whack-a-mole tonight, boys,” she says, <em>excited</em>, and she and Yuuji begin their absurd game.</p><p>Megumi watches, not sure if he’s supposed to feel disgusted, embarrassed, or impressed by their actions and abilities.</p><p>“Megumi!
 Megumi you gotta help us!!” Yuuji says, using his literally superhuman 
abilities to accurately throw french fries and burger bits into Sukuna’s
 mouth as it appears all over his body with genuinely terrifying 
accuracy.</p><p>Megumi doesn’t say anything. He thinks he’s forgotten how.</p><p>“Megumi, have you got a drop of <em>pine oil</em> for a brain?” Nobara says, using her free hand to smack her palm into his forehead. “Help us, you knucklehead!”</p><p>Almost
 as if to show him, Nobara swipes up one of his four absolutely abysmal 
looking mozzarella sticks, grabs hold of Yuuji’s hand, forces Sukuna’s 
stupid little mouth open, and <em>shoves</em> it right in there.</p><p>Sukuna’s mouth disappears, and for several solid minutes, the kids sit in tense silence, waiting for it to pop up again.</p><p>Yuuji
 pats himself down, slowly at first, then with developing manic energy. 
He stops suddenly, looks up at his friends. “I think he’s gone,” he 
says.</p><p>Megumi looks visibly surprised, while Nobara’s eyeballs are about two millimeters from actually falling out of her skull.</p><p>“Are you saying we fed the legendary <em>King</em> of <em>Curses</em> a mozzarella stick <em>so bad</em> it <em>killed</em> him?” she says, flicking the crumbs of said murderous mozzarella stick off her fingers.</p><p>Megumi
 reaches into his pocket and dredges up all the spare change he had on 
him, dumps into the center of the table. “Who gives a shit,” he says, 
borderline hisses. “We need to get out of here. Yuuji, are you still 
hungry?”</p><p>Yuuji’s stomach answers that question for him.</p><p>Megumi
 pinches the bridge of his nose. This is stupid. This is ridiculous. 
What the hell is his life. “Fuck it— I’ll break into Gojou’s secret 
pantry and cook you something when we get back.”</p><p>“Promise not to burn the compound down?” Yuuji makes these stupid giant puppy eyes and everything.</p><p>“I
 can do no such thing.” Megumi links his arm with Yuuji’s (to keep him 
from escaping) as he stands and grabs Nobara by the collar. “Empty your 
pockets; we’re <em>leaving</em>.”</p><p>“All right, all right!” Yuuji 
squirms out of Megumi’s grasp and throws his whole wallet down while 
Nobara turns her coin purse upside down .</p><p>“That should keep them 
busy,” she says, elbowing Megumi in the side to make him let her go. She
 pulls her hammer out and does a few trick tosses with it before nodding
 at the boys. “Let’s go.”</p><p>All three of them bolt for the door. No one inside even <em>blinks</em>.</p><p>Megumi
 whistles for his dogs as he bursts out the door, and they’re at his 
feet in a heartbeat, low to the ground, snapping and snarling at 
something up ahead. Megumi clenches his jaw, readying himself for what 
he’s about to see.</p><p>It promptly goes slack at the absolutely terrifying creature before the three of them.</p><p>It’s
 a curse, probably, judging from the obscene amount of cursed energy 
radiating from it. At first glance, it looks like a stag, but as it 
steps forward, comes into the sickly yellow light still streaming out 
the diner’s windows, it’s clearly not, what with the front-facing eyes 
and an open mouth full of sharp, <em>glistening</em> teeth.</p><p>All three kids’ blood runs <em>cold</em>.</p><p>The curse takes another step forward, and the next thing Nobara notices about it is its <em>putrid</em> stench. She crouches down, slowly picks a few nails out of their pouch, and infuses them with cursed energy.</p><p>Beside her, Yuuji cracks his knuckles, his fists beginning to glow blue. “You guys ready?”</p><p>Megumi
 brings his dogs back in, reaches into his shadow pocket, and pulls out a
 sword. “If either of you die,” he says through gritted teeth, “I’m 
going to kill you.”</p><p>Nobara faces him and laughs. She does a flip 
toss with her hammer as she pulls out her nails and imbues them with her
 cursed energy. “Aww, you’re worried about <em>us</em>? How cute.” She tosses her nails up, and as she turns away from Megumi, she <em><strong>SLAMS</strong></em> her hammer into them, sending them flying into the beast’s face faster than the naked eye can trace.</p><p>The
 beast roars; the ground trembles at the sound. The nails slow midair; 
Nobara digs her heels into the ground, grits her teeth, and forces more 
cursed energy into the nails. She’s not used to this type of force, but 
that’s not what concerns her.</p><p>Meanwhile, Yuuji breaks into a 
sprint, eyes glowing as he charges at the beast; there’s nothing going 
through his mind, just the one-track desire to <em>win</em>.</p><p>The beast turns to face him (and okay, he <em>feels</em>
 that in the way his organs shiver inside his belly), and Nobara’s nails
 dig into its neck, right around where the jugular would be if it were 
really alive. The force of its resulting roar tugs at Yuuji’s hair like a
 strong wind would, and so he punches it square in the nose.</p><p>“SHUT
 UP!” he screams, basically inverting its face with the power of his 
bare fist. With his other hand, he latches onto its antlers, using his 
momentum to swing onto the creature’s head. “Megumi! Toss me a weapon!”</p><p>Megumi
 mumbles an apology to Maki-senpai as he reaches into his shadow pocket 
for a random weapon, throwing it up to Yuuji. Nobara snaps her fingers, 
her nails instantly sinking into the tender flesh of the beast, which 
screams and flails in pain.</p><p>Yuuji grits his teeth, but somehow 
manages to catch what Megumi’s thrown him— some sort of giant, square 
butcher's knife. He hacks off the beast's ear (messy work, but he 
manages it), tosses it down to Nobara, and jumps off before the writhing
 can throw him off.</p><p>"Do the resonance thing!" he shouts from halfway down.</p><p>"Oh, like I needed to be <em>told</em>?" she snaps. She jumps back, whips the doll out of her tool belt, and throws it down as the ear lands in front of her.</p><p>"Well, ex-<em>cuse</em> me, princess! I’m <em>trying</em> to communicate here!"</p><p>(Megumi rolls his eyes, luckily having <em>time </em>for that as he awaits the perfect moment to strike.)</p><p>Nobara
 slams her hammer into a half dozen more cursed nails. “Resonance!” she 
screams, but her voice is lost in the thunderous ring that comes out of 
them.</p><p>The beast freezes up, and <em>finally</em>, it’s Megumi’s turn. He adjusts his grip on his sword, then charges at the beast, slicing it all the way down its belly.</p><p>He skids to a stop, flicks the blood off the blade, and pivots around, expecting to see the cursed beast at <em>least</em> disintegrating from that strike.</p><p>But
 it’s not. It’s watering the earth with its blood (and bizarre, 
alien-like plants spring up from where it falls), still standing despite
 it all. In fact, it starts moving again, first shaking itself out, then
 regenerating <em>everything</em> the kids damaged. It starts to glow 
blue, cursed energy surrounding it and billowing out like flames that 
have just been fed eight gallons of gasoline.</p><p>Nobara stops 
breathing for a second, her straw doll glowing with raw, foreign energy 
before it disintegrates itself. “Shit,” she hisses. While this isn’t a 
first in her life, it <em>has</em> been many years since she’s fought something so much more overwhelmingly powerful.</p><p>Beside
 her, Yuuji adopts a fighting stance again. Some idiots never learn, and
 in a battle of stubbornness, he’d beat even an ass. Well, if he’s going
 to try again—</p><p>Megumi dumps his sword back into his shadow pocket and summons Nue. He jumps upon its back and shouts, “Nobara!”</p><p>In a flash, Nobara shoves her hammer back into its belt loop, snatches up Yuuji by the hoodie, and makes a break for it.</p><p>“Ack!”
 Yuuji stammers, caught off guard. Being suddenly jerked back and 
dragged away at accelerations typically only achievable by sports 
vehicles will do that to you.</p><p>“We’re leaving,” Nobara says, 
adjusting her grip on his hood once, twice, then ultimately just giving 
up on that, tossing him up a bit so that she can just carry him under 
her arm instead.</p><p>“What??” Yuuji wriggles for a bit, just to get a 
bit more comfortable, but it’s a little bit pointless since Megumi 
swoops in and picks them both up in Nue’s claws. “What’s going on?” he 
sputters, twisting around to look back at the monster they’ve left 
behind. Its cursed energy output has died off, and it’s not pursuing 
them. It just shakes out its head and lumbers back into the darkness 
whence it came. What about all the curses in the diner?”</p><p>“Whatever
 that thing is, it’s too powerful for us right now,” Megumi tells him. 
“And we can’t exorcise the diner if we’ve been killed by that giant 
special grade thing.”</p><p>“What if we brought in Gojou-sensei later?”</p><p>Noticing Nue tiring, Megumi reaches over and knocks each of his friends on the head. “Brace yourselves,” he tells them.</p><p>“What???” Yuuji shouts, and they all tumble to the forest floor.</p><p>Megumi cracks his knuckles and swipes at a bit of blood oozing from a scrape on his cheek. “I <em>told</em> you to brace yourself.”</p><p>“And I was <em>asking</em> you why we can’t go get Gojou-sensei to help us later!” Yuuji snips, sitting upright.</p><p>Nobara groans, wiping a smear of mud off her jaw. “Are you <em>crazy</em>?”
 she caps. “If we tell him we had a midnight adventure without him, he’s
 gonna fall to pieces so fast, we’ll all be hit by the shrapnel!” She 
picks herself up and brushes the dirt and leaves into Yuuji’s face just 
for kicks.</p><p>Yuuji spits out a leaf. “Can you not?”</p><p>Nobara huffs, mad that her joke didn’t land.</p><p>Megumi
 looks upwards, at the fragments of the sky visible through the 
treetops. “Let’s just come back in the morning,” he says. It’s been a 
long night; they’re all exhausted. He doesn’t have the brainpower to 
manage this right now.</p><p>“All right,” Yuuji sighs, standing up. He shakes himself out all at once like a dog, somehow not dirtying anyone like that.</p><p>They
 tiredly amble out of the dark woods, miraculously finding the trail 
out, and creep back into the building. Absently, Megumi checks a clock— 
4:18? He must be imagining things, he decides.</p><p>The three of them stumble into Yuuji’s room and crash into a heap together, fast asleep the second their heads hit the bed.</p><p>But they never find the diner again.</p></div>

 i know that megumi canonically does like black coffee, but by the time i
 remembered this, i'd already written the joke so it's too late now.<br>i
 wrote the first half of this by hand in my tiny notebook because my 
computer was out for repairs wah. also sorry if it loses its comedic 
charm towards the end. writing fights has been a weak point of mine for a
 long time, and while i'm definitely proud of my progress, focusing on 
making it good here meant sacrificing the comedic tone.</p><p>i actually
 considered splitting this into five shorter chapters ("the quest for 
the cheesed burger" "first rule of creepy dolls" "time for YOU to get a 
watch" "dish of the day" and "night in the woods") because um i like 
attention, but i decided against it. after all, it's not every day i 
pump out a oneshot this long that's not also broken into segments. </p><p>anyway yeah! thank you for reading, follow me on tumblr @<a href="https://hua-fei-hua.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow">hua-fei-hua</a>
 where i don't shut up about jjk and my writing in general. leave a 
comment or some kudos if you're so inclined, and stay safe out there</p></blockquote>
